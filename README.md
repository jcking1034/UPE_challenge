# UPE Coding Challenge

My solution to a coding challenge that was a requirement for joining Upsilon Pi Epsilon, a computer science honor society at UCLA. The problem statement can be found [here](https://gist.github.com/kylewong975/1af2ad3bcd81d3b520263700f0e78fe8?fbclid=IwAR1j75oVWc26BYXo5YSX1csVvywBhvfy4n5gIDfYkDMWoXhUoVU087QjjHY)

To run, use the following command:
```
python3 maze_solver.py
```
NOTE: My UID is stored as `id` on line 4

To check completion, use the following command:
```
python3 check_completed.py
```

minimal_maze_solver.py contains a version of maze_solver.py that is much more compact.
